    "Joke": "Bob received a parrot for his birthday. The parrot was fully grown, with avery bad attitude and worse vocabulary.Every other word was an expletive; those that weren't expletives were, tosay the least, rude. Bob tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words,playing softmusic...anything he could think of. Nothing worked.He yelled at the bird, and the bird got worse. He shook the bird, and thebird got madder and more rude.Finally, in a moment of desperation, Bob put the parrot in the freezer.For a few moments he heard the bird swearing, squawking, kicking andscreaming and then, suddenly, there was absolute quiet. Bob was frightened that he mighthave actuallyhurt the bird, and quickly opened the freezer door.The parrot calmly stepped out onto Bob's extended arm and said, \"I'm sorrythat I offended you with my language and my actions, and I ask your forgiveness. I willendeavour to correctmy behaviour\".Bob was astounded at the changes in the bird's attitude and was about toask what had changed him, when the parrot continued, \"May I ask what the Chickendid?"
